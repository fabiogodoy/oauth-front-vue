This is a project cloned from CoreUI, a free admin template based on the most populars js frameworks, see details below.

CoreUI is based on Bootstrap 4 and offers 6 versions: [HTML5 AJAX](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-bootstrap-admin-template-ajax), [HTML5 Static](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-bootstrap-admin-template), [AngularJS](https://github.com/mrholek/CoreUI-AngularJS), [Angular 2+](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-angular-admin-template), [React.js](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-react-admin-template) & [Vue.js](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-vue-admin-template).

This version uses VueJS dist, and it was modified to work with my another project [OAuth2 With Spring Boot] 
(https://github.com/fabiogodoy/spring-boot-oauth2)

Here we have a form to create new users using OAuth2 architecture, and also a form for authentication.

Another important note is tha all routes are secure, except login, so if you try to access a protected resource you will be redirect to login page.

It is just a PoC but I think that could be useful.
